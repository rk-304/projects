# Data Science Projects

This repo aims to provide an overview about my data science project during my studies. The code and/or report to the different projects you may find in the respective folders. The projects were done in mostly in Jupyter notebook or with R Markdown. 

*Projects with R:*
- Machine Learning with R – movie recommender using neural networks for binary movie classification
- Data analysis and visualization with R - Kaggle project, analyzing Kickstarter project, what are the success factors

*Projects with Python:*
- Modelling and analyzing social network interactions using NetworkX – Copenhagen University student network data
- Deep learning in Vision with Keras and Tensorflow – convolutional neural networks for beer bottle identification on pictures
- Customer churn prediction with Python for a bank
- Semantic analysis of Twitter data with Python – climate change impacts on users
- Web crawling and data wrangling with Python for European football leagues from Transfermarkt

*Data warehousing - SQL /  NoSQL:*
- Designing and implementing an ELT process with data lake on Amazon AWS - streaming and analyzing data from Twitter
- Data modelling for MySQL and PostgreSQL databases for IMDB movie data and Twitter data
- Graph data modelling and link prediction using machine learning with Neo4j for the thesis work 

*Data visualization with Tableau:*
