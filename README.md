# Data Science Projects

This repo aims to provide an overview about my data science project during my master's studies. The code and/or report to the different projects you may find in the respective folders. The projects were done in mostly in Jupyter notebook or with R Markdown. 

*Projects with R:*
- Machine Learning with R – movie recommender using neural networks for binary movie classification
- Data analysis and visualization with R - Kaggle project, analyzing Kickstarter project, what are the success factors

*Projects with Python:*
- Modelling and analyzing social network interactions using NetworkX – Copenhagen University student network data
- Deep learning in Vision with Keras and Tensorflow – convolutional neural networks for beer bottle identification on pictures
- Customer churn prediction with Python for a bank
- Semantic analysis of Twitter data with Python – climate change impacts on users
- Web crawling and data wrangling with Python for European football leagues from Transfermarkt

*Data warehousing - SQL /  NoSQL:*
- Designing and implementing an ELT process with data lake on Amazon AWS - streaming and analyzing data from Twitter
- Data modelling for MySQL and PostgreSQL databases for IMDB movie data and Twitter data
- Graph data modelling and link prediction using machine learning with Neo4j for the thesis work 

*Data visualization with Tableau:*
- Data visualization of New York vehicles accident with Tableau to identify accident hotspots on the NYC map

My master thesis is having a confidential closure, therefore I am not allowed to share the code or the thesis itsself. However, together with my supervisors, we have publised a paper based on my master thesis. You can access the paper here: https://doi.org/10.3390/knowledge2020017

Furthermore my scientific poster, based on my thesis, was selected for the Applied Machine Learning Days conference (March 2022, Lausanne, CH). The latest version of my poster you can view here: [Poster_v3_portrait.pdf](https://github.com/rk-304/projects/files/9084202/Poster_v3_portrait.pdf)

Last but not least I am happy to receive any feedbacks or share more information about the projects in person, if you are interested. 

Disclosure: The shared files are partly the final version of group works containing work of others and my individual contribution.
